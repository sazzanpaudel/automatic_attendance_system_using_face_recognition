# automatic_attendance_system_using_face_recognition
In this digital era, the most common difficulty that every teacher face in classroom is to take  the attendance of the student one by one in each and every class.
For the time being many  automated systems has been proposed for taking student attendance. Here, we introduce  automated student attendance system using face detection 
and recognition. Face recognition  system play a vital role in every sector. It is one of the mostly used bio-metrics despite of  having low accuracy when compared
to iris recognition and fingerprint. Traditional method  for taking attendance is writing roll number of student's and record the attendance in sheet which  takes
a lot of time. To overcome the problem of wastage of time, incorrect attendance, the  proposed system gives a method like when he enters the class room, system marks
by  extracting the image using Haarcascade Classifier algorithm. Student datas are collected in databse which includes name of  the students, there images and roll number
, department and other detail. It carries an entry in  log report of every student of each subject and generate the attendance of the student.
